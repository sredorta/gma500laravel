/*
200: OK. The standard success code and default option.
201: Object created. Useful for the store actions.
204: No content. When an action was executed successfully, but there is no content to return.
206: Partial content. Useful when you have to return a paginated list of resources.
400: Bad request. The standard option for requests that fail to pass validation.
401: Unauthorized. The user needs to be authenticated.
403: Forbidden. The user is authenticated, but does not have the permissions to perform an action.
404: Not found. This will be returned automatically by Laravel when the resource is not found.
500: Internal server error. Ideally you're not going to be explicitly returning this, but if something unexpected breaks, this is what your user is going to receive.
503: Service unavailable. Pretty self explanatory, but also another code that is not going to be returned explicitly by the application
